Decision Tree Classification Project
Objective
The objective of this project is to apply Decision Tree Classification to a given dataset, analyze the model's performance, and interpret the results.

Project Tasks
1. Data Preparation
Loaded the dataset into the analysis environment using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed EDA to understand the dataset structure.
Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Visualized feature distributions using histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices.
3. Feature Engineering
Applied feature engineering techniques:
Encoded categorical variables.
Scaled numerical features.
Handled missing data.
4. Decision Tree Classification
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.
Implemented the Decision Tree Classification model using scikit-learn.
Evaluated model performance using:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
ROC-AUC
5. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimized the Decision Tree model by experimenting with:
Maximum depth
Minimum samples split
Criterion (e.g., Gini or Entropy)
6. Model Evaluation and Analysis
Analyzed model performance based on evaluation metrics.
Visualized the decision tree structure to understand the rules and identify important features.
Results
